## About the Project
**The Runner's Counter** is the second project created within the **Full Stack Development** course, which I am taking on [start2impact](https://www.start2impact.it/). 

The goal of the project is to build a **JavaScript application** that functions as a **counter**.

For the **design of the counter** I was inspired by my great passion, running. In fact, the counter has the shape of a **smartwatch**, an essenial tool for runners who always want to keep track of the route and kilometers run during their workouts or races.

The counter has **0** as its **initial value** and is made up of the following **buttons**:
* the **Plus Button (+)**, which allows the user to **increase** the value of the counter; 
* the **Minus Button (-)**, which allows the user to **decrease** the value of the counter; 
* the **Reset Button (R)**, which instead allows the user to **reset** the value to 0.
